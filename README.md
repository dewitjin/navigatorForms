## Contributors

The best way to reach me is via my email at dewi.tjin + @ + gmail.com.

If you would like to contribute please fork the repo and I will review code.  I would like help/advice on how to add a feature to deal with cleaning up long text in CSV files, and deal with commas and spaces in cell so I don't have to deal with it manually.
